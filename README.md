List of Organizations which support Natural Disasters-

1.)The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)-

Brief Info:

The world is changing fast, more people are becoming vulnerable to disasters or are forced to cope with acts of violence, financial crises and growing uncertainty, often without adequate support from their governments. With  new challenges to humanitarian coordination, concerns over standards and accountability, more capable states and National Societies exercising leadership over humanitarian response and presenting new opportunities to mobilize the collective resources of the IFRC in non-traditional ways, the IFRC must learn, adapt, innovate, and lead to ensure that we remain relevant and achieve greater impact with our humanitarian work. We strive  to ensure that a well-functioning, relevant global disaster management system is in place to address the needs of vulnerable people affected by disasters and crises, by working as part of an effective global disaster management team to:

Provide leadership for the development of global disaster and crises management policies and programming approaches, with a focus on disseminating the Principles and Rules for RCRC Humanitarian Assistance, supporting the process of strengthening Movement coordination and cooperation.

Promote IFRC-wide tools and capacities for disaster and crises in the areas of response preparedness and contingency planning, disaster needs assessment, relief to recovery planning, the scaled-up use of cash in emergencies and global surge capacity systems.

Improve the timeliness and quality of Emergency Appeal and DREF-supported operations through Emergency Plans of Action and support to resource mobilisation efforts.

3.)International Accounting Standards Committee(IASC)-

Brief Info:

Created by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly resolution 46/182 in 1991, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee is the longest-standing and highest-level humanitarian coordination forum of the UN system, bringing together the executive heads of 18 UN and non-UN organizations to ensure coherence of preparedness and response efforts, formulate policy, and agree on priorities for strengthened humanitarian action. The IASC is chaired by the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) and facilitates the leadership role of the UN Secretary-General by regularly convening to ensure better preparation for, as well as rapid and coherent response to, humanitarian crises.

The responsibilities of the IASC include: making strategic and policy decisions with system-wide implications; endorsing major operational decisions; arbitration where no consensus can be reached by other IASC structures; advocating common principles, collectively or individually on behalf of the IASC; approving the work plans of the IASC structures; bringing issues to the attention of the Secretary-General and Security Council through the ERC; and, designating Humanitarian Coordinators and selecting coordination arrangements.

The Committee is supported by subsidiary bodies; groups of decision-makers and experts who inform and carry out the priorities set by the IASC.

5.)The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA):

Brief Info:

OFDA responds to an average of 65 disasters in more than 50 countries every year to ensure aid reaches people affected by rapid-onset disasters—such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and floods—and slow-onset crises, including drought and conflict.  OFDA fulfills its mandate of saving lives, alleviating human suffering, and reducing the social and economic impact of disasters worldwide in partnership with USAID functional and regional bureaus and other U.S. Government agencies.

OFDA experts worldwide and in D.C. help countries prepare for, respond to, and recover from humanitarian crises.  OFDA works with the international humanitarian community to give vulnerable populations resources to build resilience and strengthen their own ability to respond to emergencies.

When disaster strikes, OFDA sends regional and technical experts to the affected country to identify and prioritize humanitarian needs.  In the wake of a large-scale disaster, OFDA can deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to coordinate and manage an optimal U.S. Government response, while working closely with local officials, the international community, and relief agencies.  OFDA also maintains stocks of emergency relief supplies in warehouses worldwide and has the logistical and operational capabilities to deliver them quickly.
